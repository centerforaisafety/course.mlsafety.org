# ML Safety Course

In the last decade, deep learning has taken off as a field. The number of papers
published by the NeurIPS conference increased six-fold from 2010 to 2020. And
big tech companies now spend billions of dollars on AI research and
development. (Just DeepMind alone spent $1.06 billion in 2020.) 

Yet deep learning systems are known to have problems: they are brittle to
distribution shifts; they’re easily manipulated by adversaries; they don’t
recognize when they should be uncertain; and so on. Such challenges are
well-documented by academics and must be addressed when deploying real-world
systems.

For these reasons, a key part of industrial deep learning is safety engineering.
Because the field is so new, very few deep learning courses try to
systematically cover safety engineering. The **ML Safety Course**, created by
[Dan Hendrycks](http://hendrycks.com) and TODO, aims to provide a comprehensive overview of safety
engineering to train engineers in this nascent field.
